# Activity Life Cycle

### Notes

- each app runs in its own process
- when starting the activity Android system call  onCreate()
- Handler used to schedule code
- rotation change device configuration
- changing configuration Android recreate the activity
- Activity -> ContextThemeWrapper -> ContextWrapper -> Cotext
- onCreate called when the activity first created
- onStart when activity is partial visible
- onResume called if the activity have focus
- onPause called if the activity is loss focus
- onStop called if the activity is not visible
- onDestroy called if the activity destroyed
- onRestart called if the activity is became visible again

### Code  Snippet

```java
// create a new handler object
Handler handler = new Handler();
// post used to run the code immediately in background thread
handler.post(new Runnable(){
    @override
    public void run(){
        // do some thing
    } 
});
// postDelayed used to run the code after (n) miils in background thread
handler.postDelayed(new Runnable(){
    @override
    public void run(){
        // do some thing
    } 
}, timeToDelay);
// to run the code continously
handler.postDelayed(new Runnable(){
    @override
    public void run(){
        // do some thing
        handler.postDelayed(this, timeToDelay);
    }
}, n);
```
